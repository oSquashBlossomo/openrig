// Slice-03 (OPR.0.4.8.3) Seam B — permission_policy REF resolution + precedence + launch-posture.
// The `permission_policy` value attached to a rig or a seat is a REF (not a policy body). Semantics
// are grounded in Slice03 README v4 (sha256-8 d65afe67), rulings A1/A2/A3 + the Policy/YOLO framing:
//   - `builtin:<name>`, <name> ∈ {locked, standard, open, yolo} (A1): resolves into the packaged
//     read-only built-in set (origin=builtin). Unknown name = STRUCTURED error listing the known
//     set. The `builtin:` prefix is MANDATORY — bare canonical names never resolve (no shadowing).
//   - a RELATIVE custom path (A2), resolved relative to the DECLARING RigSpec dir (origin=custom);
//     absolute / `..` traversal / empty segments = STRUCTURED error (a spec defect, NOT a floor
//     fallback). Reuses the established safe-path discipline (path-safety.validateSafePath).
//   - `none` = the RECORDED DELIBERATE choice (RULED-FORM-deliberate-none-2026-08-04,
//     sha256 5f37e40f — the A3 reservation ACTIVATED by its own amendment): third origin
//     deliberate_none, never resolves to any file, posture identical to absent (floor).
//   - ABSENT (no value) = the floor (honest absence) — the CALLER passes undefined; not an error.
// Built-in ASSET packaging is a LATER leg: builtin resolution here is REF-SEMANTICS (prefix→origin),
// it does NOT read or require the asset file to exist.
