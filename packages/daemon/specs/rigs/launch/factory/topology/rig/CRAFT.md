# Rig Craft — shipped defaults (factory)

<!-- Shipped by the factory rig spec (copy-if-absent; append freely — a
     later rig-up never overwrites). Rig-wide norms every member holds. -->

- **If another seat must ACT, it needs a queue row.** A send informs; only a
  row creates an auditable obligation. Pass work with `rig queue handoff` so
  the close and the create are one transaction.
- **A turn holding work ends by handing off or naming a live blocker.**
  Ending a turn with a summary in your own terminal is going dark: from
  outside, a clean finish and a crash are identical.
- **Triage your board by baton, never by count.** A claimed row with an owner
  is work; an informational row is not. `rig queue transitions <id>` tells a
  deliberate park from a strand — the row's face cannot.
- **Transport negatives lie.** A timeout is INDETERMINATE, not failed:
  reconcile by ID before any retry, or you fork the row. Never re-send on a
  negative signal; confirm by reading the far end.
- **Count methods, not votes.** Seats that ran the same command in the same
  tree are one datapoint wearing several hats.
- **State the rigor level you chose for a dispatched task, in one line.**
  Heavy process is earned by irreversibility, not importance.
