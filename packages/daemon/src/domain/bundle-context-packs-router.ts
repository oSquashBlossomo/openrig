/**
 * Bundle context_packs router (Item 6 / slice-05 Checkpoint 7.3f step 2).
 *
 * Pure function. Copies context-pack directories declared in a bundle
 * manifest's context_packs[] block from the bundle's extracted tree to
 * the operator context-packs library. No daemon dependencies — fully
 * unit-testable via FsOps injection.
 *
 * Per PRD §Item 6 line 196: context_packs entries are paths to a
 * context-pack's manifest.yaml file inside the bundle. The PACK is the
 * PARENT DIRECTORY of that manifest.yaml (per context-pack-types.ts:9-10
 * and context-pack-library-service.ts:50-77: a pack is a directory whose
 * immediate children include manifest.yaml + the referenced content
 * files). The router copies that parent dir to
 * <targetContextPacksDir>/<basename(parentDir)>/ — the operator-host
 * canonical layout the live consumer scans.
 *
 * Banked degenerate-input dogfood discipline (extended from the
 * workflow_specs basename-collision + non-YAML cycles): every router
 * commit explicitly probes the failure-class edges through the live
 * consumer's contract before claiming routedCount truthful. For
 * context_packs the consumer-invisibility classes are:
 *   - Declared path basename is NOT "manifest.yaml" → consumer never
 *     scans (it looks for manifest.yaml at the pack dir root). status=
 *     not_manifest.
 *   - Two declared paths whose parent-dir basename collide → second
 *     would silently overwrite the first; status=conflict; first wins.
 *   - Source pack dir not present in bundle → status=missing (honest skip).
 *   - Source path escapes bundleRoot → status=unsafe.
 *   - Lore-classed or structurally internal content → status=lore_refused
 *     or substance_refused, before copy.
 *
 * Both-sides containment (banked
 * feedback_pre_existing_trust_boundary_reuse_canonical_helper addendum):
 * source-side under bundleRoot, target-side under targetContextPacksDir
 * (target via basename so structurally safe; defensive check retained).
 *
 * /install handler integration lands at Checkpoint 7.3f step 3 with a
 * real consumer-scan() proof against the routed dir (mirror of the
 * workflow_specs scanWorkflowSpecFolder reachability proof at d81456dc).
