// D12 base-health + WRITE-leak containment (broadcast-leak atom).
//
// The Node test suites MUST NOT inherit the seat's live-daemon connection. Two holes:
//
// 1. Connection-redirect env (OPENRIG_URL / OPENRIG_PORT / OPENRIG_HOST + RIGGED_*
//    aliases) — honored as a real operator override in production, but ambient inside
//    a seat it bypasses each test's injected mock daemon (up.test.ts: 29 fails ambient
//    vs 1 hermetic). Scrubbed below. Production behavior is untouched.
//
// 2. The DEFAULT STATE_FILE discovery — `OPENRIG_HOME/daemon.json` (daemon-lifecycle
//    `OPENRIG_DIR = OPENRIG_HOME`). Scrubbing the env is NOT enough: with URL/PORT
//    unset, the CLI falls back to the live daemon's state file. This is exactly how
//    `broadcast.test.ts` emitted REAL 'System maintenance' broadcasts to 14 seats.
//    The READ direction (results pollution) was known; the WRITE direction (emitting
//    into the live topology) is strictly worse.
//
// FORCE + ASSERT (unwritable-by-omission — the guarantee lives where it cannot be
// skipped, so a new test file inherits safety from the setup that runs first, not
// from a runner or a per-file convention that 145/164 files already omit):
//   FORCE  — establish a fixture-scoped OPENRIG_HOME (a fresh temp dir carrying the
//            `.openrig-fixture` marker) BEFORE any daemon-resolving module loads and
//            captures the eager `OPENRIG_HOME` const, so default discovery finds no
//            live daemon.
//   ASSERT — `assertFixtureScopedHome` throws LOUD if the home is NOT fixture-scoped
//            (mkdtemp failure, or OPENRIG_HOME captured before this ran via an
//            import-order regression). Forcing alone silently fixes and proves
//            nothing; the assert makes it evidence. Its known-negative lives in
//            live-daemon-guard.test.ts.
