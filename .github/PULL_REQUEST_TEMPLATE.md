<!-- Thanks for the PR. Three short answers are all a reviewer needs. -->

## What a user gets

<!-- One or two sentences: the behaviour before, the behaviour after. Link the issue if there is one. -->

## How you verified it

<!-- What you actually ran and saw, and which revision/local changes you tested. The documented checks are `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run test:ui`, and `npm run lint`; say what you could not run. Redact credentials and private information from logs or screenshots. -->

## Anything you were unsure about

<!-- Design choices, edge cases you did not cover, places a reviewer should look hardest. Empty is a fine answer. -->

## If this is security-related

<!-- Exploitable? Report it privately first (SECURITY.md). Otherwise: how does this go wrong for someone using OpenRig as designed (your own machine or a trusted private network), with evidence? Who causes it, and how do they reach the install? What does the change cost everyone else? See CONTRIBUTING.md. -->

- [ ] One concern per PR; no version bump; no `CHANGELOG.md` edit
- [ ] Tests added or updated where the change is testable
- [ ] I listed the checks I ran, their results, and any checks I could not run
