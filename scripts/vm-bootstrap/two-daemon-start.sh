# Slice 22 (release-0.3.1) — VM preview two-daemon bootstrap.
#
# Starts two OpenRig daemons in the same VM with fully isolated state
# (separate OPENRIG_HOME dirs, distinct ports, distinct SQLite paths)
# so a founder can compare a blank-slate "first install" UI to a
# pre-populated "lived-in" UI side-by-side.
#
# Operator workflow (per <substrate-shared-docs>/openrig-work/conventions/vm-preview/README.md):
#   1. Provision a Tart VM with OpenRig CLI installed.
#   2. Run this script.
#   3. Open two browser tabs:
#        http://<vm-ip>:7433  →  blank-slate (default, fresh install UX)
#        http://<vm-ip>:7434  →  populated  (sample rig + qitems for "lived-in" UX)
#   4. To reset, see "RESET" section at the bottom of this file.
#
# Pre-conditions (operator install before running this):
#   - `rig` CLI on PATH
#   - Tailscale daemon active OR explicit LAN bind via OPENRIG_HOST (see
#     auth-bearer-tailscale-trust slice for the bind rules)
#
# Architecture note (forward-fix #1): the CLI's parent-process module-
# level constants (OPENRIG_DIR / STATE_FILE / LOG_FILE in
# packages/cli/src/daemon-lifecycle.ts) resolve from OPENRIG_HOME at
# import time. So per-invocation `OPENRIG_HOME=<dir> rig daemon start`
# isolates BOTH the spawned daemon's state AND the CLI's lifecycle
# bookkeeping (daemon.json, daemon.log) in the same dir. The earlier
# attempt to add a `--openrig-home` flag was dropped because it only
# threaded into the spawned child, leaving the parent CLI's state
# writes on the default ~/.openrig path.
#
# Idempotency: each daemon's $OPENRIG_HOME has its own daemon.json, so
# re-running the script after a clean shutdown re-creates state. If a
# daemon is still running, `rig daemon start` (under the matching
# OPENRIG_HOME) refuses to launch a duplicate.
