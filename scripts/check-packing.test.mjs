// aa922842 — the conventions doc reaches agents through a THREE-path model:

//   packed INTERNAL  daemon/docs/reference/sdlc-conventions.md     (assembly input only —

//   installed stable $OPENRIG_HOME/reference/sdlc-conventions.md   (default ~/.openrig/…)
// The daemon materializes the stable path at startup by reading `../docs/reference`
// relative to its dist dir (packages/daemon/src/startup.ts), which is exactly why
// scripts/build-package.sh stages the docs at daemon/docs/reference/. That internal input
// is therefore load-bearing and completely unguarded today: if the copy step regressed, the
// stable path would silently stop materializing and every teaching pointer would go stale
// with no failing test. This pins it.
// HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION: packages/cli/daemon is gitignored build output, so any assertion
// that reads it (or runs `npm pack` against it) passes on a developer machine with a stale
// assembled package and FAILS in a clean checkout before anything is built. This test therefore
// asserts the three contracts that make the stable path work, using only git-tracked inputs,
// and never runs or mutates the real package build.
